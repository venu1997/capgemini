Difference between abstract class and interface

abstract class
1)if we are talking about implementation but not completely(partial implementation) then we should go for abstract class.
2)Every method present in abstract class need not be public and abstract.In addition to abstract methods we can take conrete methods also.
3)There are no restrictions on abstract class method modifiers
4)The variables present inside abstract class need not be public,static and final.
5)There are no restrictions on abstract class variable modifiers.
6)For abstract class variables it is not required to perform initialization at the time of declaration.
7)Inside abstract class we can declare instance and static blocks.
8)Inside abstract class we can declare constructor, which will be executed at the time of child object creation.


interface
1)
If we don't know anything about implementation just we have requirement specification then we should go for interface.
2)Inside interface every method is always public and abstract whether we are declaring or not.Hence interface is also considered as 100% pure abstract class.
3)We can't declare interface method with the following modifiers
public(allowed) ------private,protected(enemy list)(not allowed)
abstract(allowed)----final,static,synchronized,native,strictfp(not allowed)
4)Every variable present inside interface is always public,static and final whether we are declaring or not.
5)We can't declare interface variables with the following members:
private,protected,transient,volatile(keep on changing)
6)For interface variables compulsory we should perform initialization at the time of declaration otherwise we will get compile time error.
7)Inside interface we can't declare instance and static blocks. Otherwise we will get compile time error.
8)Inside interface we can't declare constructors.



abstract class Bank{    
abstract int getRateOfInterest();    
}    
    
class SBI extends Bank{    
int getRateOfInterest(){return 7;}    
}    
class PNB extends Bank{    
int getRateOfInterest(){return 8;}    
}    
    
class TestBank
{    
  public static void main(String args[])
  {    
    Bank b=new SBI();//if object is PNB, method of PNB will be invoked    
    int interest=b.getRateOfInterest();    
    System.out.println("Rate of Interest is: "+interest+" %");    

  }
}
