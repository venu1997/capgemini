CopyOnWriteArraySet 
-------------------

Collection(I)

Set(I) extends Collection

CopyOnWriteArraySet(C) implements Set

-it is threadsafe version of Set
-Internally implemented by CopyOnWriteArrayList.
-insertion order is preserved(Internally CopyOnWriteArrayList).
-duplicate objects are not allowed
-only one null is allowed.
-can add heterogeneous objects.
-multiple threads can able to perform read operation simultaneosly but for every update operation  a separate copy will be created.
-as for every update opertion a separate cloned copy will be created which is costly. Hence if multiple update operation are required then it is not recommended to use CopyOnWriteArraySet.
-while one thread iterating Set the other threads are allowed to modify Set and we won't get ConcurrentModificationException.
-Iterator of CopyOnWriteArraySet can perform only read operation and won't perform remove operation otherwise we will get RuntimeException: UnsupportedOperationException.

constructors
------------
CopyOnWriteArraySet c=new CopyOnWriteArraySet();
CopyOnWriteArraySet c=new CopyOnWriteArraySet(Collection c);


methods 
-------
no new methods
because set doesn't allowed duplicate objects.
